                                Metacuki is a journey of one web developer student to success. Every small project made here is made just for fun and to practice learned lessons. As you could already tell, my projects are not complex and fancy as someone would expect them to be, but it is just a matter of time for them to be all of that. I will be uploading more and more projects over time and they will be getting better and more useful. The goal of this website is to see my progress and hopefully someday help one of you in some everyday tasks.
